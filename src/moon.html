      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <p>The moon exists as earth's silent companion and it bears the scars of such. The moon protects us from astroid after astroid that would see the end of the human life on Earth. It does all that without complaning or wavering. Why does it do it? It can't gain anything from it. Can it? We surely won't give it any thanks. Humans never notice things until there gone. Its not human's fault. We are just not wired to appreciate things that we experiance everyday. We take them for granted. Once we have something we want the next thing. It's the reason that no matter how much money people make they always feel like they need to make more money. We never take a step back and look at what we already have. No one stops to appreciate the moon because its always been there.</p>
