      <h1>Earth</h1>
      <p>The earth is the home of the Human race. Its a giant floating rock hurling through a massive unknown galaxy. We really know quite little about our galaxy as a whole. There are just so many unanswered questions about whats out there. In the end we are just a biological mistake created by a mishape of luck and cellular persistance. Its hard not to get nihilisitc when you really break life down to its component parts. Most people that occupy this rock choose not to think about it. I wish I could be liek that. I move through life like a man wearing a skin. I may be present I may be speaking with you, but I exist elsewhere. Even if this rock really isn't much, there is something amazing about our brains ability to dream. I exist entire lives in my dreams while others live out their whole singular life. Thats the only way I can stay sane on this rock.</p>
